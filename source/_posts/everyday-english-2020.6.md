# June 2020

Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to.

A thousand-li journey is started by taking the first step.

Not do a last effort, how will you make sure that you can't.

Doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment.

Achievements provide the only real pleasure in life.

Stay hungry, stay foolish.

Don't be afraid to be different.

Every ebb awaits an overwhelming flow.

If you wait, all that happens is that you get older.

To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

Ages are all equal, but genius is always above its age.

It never rains but it pours.

I can because I think I can.
