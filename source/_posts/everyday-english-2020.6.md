# June 2020

Sometimes your plans don't work out because God has better ones.

Grow old along with me; the best is yet to be.

There is no royal road to learning.

Good is good, but better carries it.

All things come to those who wait.

Weep no more, no sign. Sorrow calls no time that's gone.

You can have it all. You just can't have it all at once.

There is no coincidence in the world, only the inevitable result.

Sharp tools make good work.

Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.

A stitch in time saves nine.

We should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once.

I can stand much vilified, can afford much praise.

You will never know what you can do till you try.

To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.

When all else is lost, the future still remains.

Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to.

A thousand-li journey is started by taking the first step.

Not do a last effort, how will you make sure that you can't.

Doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment.

Achievements provide the only real pleasure in life.

Stay hungry, stay foolish.

Don't be afraid to be different.

Every ebb awaits an overwhelming flow.

If you wait, all that happens is that you get older.

To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

Ages are all equal, but genius is always above its age.

It never rains but it pours.

I can because I think I can.
