Let no feeling of discouragement prey upon you, and in the end you are sure to succeed.
不让挫败感把你吞噬，你就一定会成功。

Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
当做必做，持之以恒。

At twenty years of age, the will reigns; at thirty, the wit; and at forty, the judgment.
二十岁时起支配作用的是意志，三十岁时是机智，四十岁时是判断。

We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope.
我们必须接受失望，因为它是有限的，但千万不可失去希望，因为它是无穷的。

Fear not that the life shall come to an end, but rather fear that it shall never have a beginning.
不要害怕你的生活将要结束，应该担心你的生活永远不曾真正开始。

Our greatest glory consists not in never falling but in rising every time we fall.
我们最值得自豪的不在于从不跌倒，而在于每次跌倒之后都爬起来。

Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value.
不要为成功而努力，要为做一个有价值的人而努力。

Life is measured by thought and action, not by time.
衡量生命的尺度是思想和行为，不是时间。
