# July 2020

By falling we learn to go safely.

Every cloud has a silver lining.

Never say die.

Over prepare, and then go with the flow.

Life is too short to waste time hating anyone.

Love is composed of a single inhabiting two bodies.

Everyone's got a life that no one else knows about.

Youth is not a time of life. It's a state of mind.

As long as we live in each other's heart, death can't keep us apart.

The truth is rarely pure and never simple.

My life didn't please me, so I created my life.

Constant dropping wears the stone.
